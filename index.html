Your website should be about showcasing something you enjoy and try to "sell" that idea, whether it be through agreeing with the idea or actually using money to purchase the idea or product. You don't need to reinvent the wheel, just pretend you're making a new shopping site for somebody.

The requirements for your home page are as follows:

Create a navigation bar that has your company's logo/title on the left, navigation menu items on the right, and be mobile-friendly.
Create a footer that says "Copyright 20##" that always stays at the bottom of the webpage.
Create a splash screen with the company's tagline.
Create at least two sections that describe the company/product.
This assignment will be graded on effort and design cleanliness. It doesn't have to be final, but should have a well-established theme.
